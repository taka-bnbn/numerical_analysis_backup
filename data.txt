Equation for curvilinear motion
Hiroki Okubo
1 Curvilinear motion
We consider the kinetics of particles which move
along plane curvilinear paths. We will make use
of the three coordinate descriptions of acceleration
in curvilinear motion. The choice of an appropriate
coordinate system depends on the conditions of the
problem.
• Rectangular coordinates
ΣFx = max (1)
ΣFy = may (2)
where ax = ¨x and ay = ¨y.
• Normal and tangential coordinates
ΣFn = man (3)
ΣFt = mat (4)
where an = ρβ˙2 = v
2/ρ and at = ˙v. The
positive sense of the n-axis is toward the center
of curvature, and so the positive sense of the
force summation ΣFn must also be toward the
center of curvature to agree with the positive
sense of the acceleration an = v
2/ρ.
• Polar coordinates
ΣFr = mar (5)
ΣFθ = maθ (6)
where ar = ¨r − r
˙θ
2 and aθ = r
¨θ + 2 ˙r
˙θ.
2 Examples
1. Determine the maximum speed v which the
sliding block may have as it passes point A
without losing contact with the surface as
shown in Fig. 1.

Solution. The equation of motion in the normal direction is
mg − N = m
v

ρ
(7)
where N is the reaction force from the surface.
The force is zero, N = 0, when the block loses
contact with the surface. Substituting N = 0
into Eq. (7) gives
v =
√
gρ (8)
If the speed at A were less than √gρ, an upward normal force exerted by the surface on
the block would exist. In order for the block
to have a speed at A which is greater than
√gρ, some type of constraint would have to
be introduced to provide additional downward
force.
2. Small objects are released from rest at A and
slide down the smooth circular surface of radius R to a conveyor B. Determine the expression for the normal contact force N between the guide and each object in terms of θ
and specify the correct angular velocity ω of
the conveyor pulley of radius r to prevent any

Solution. By using the polar-coordinate
form, when the object on the circular surface
the equations of motion are
mg cos θ = mR¨θ (9)
